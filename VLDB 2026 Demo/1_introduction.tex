% provenance graphs or relevant works
Provenance/lineage graphs~\cite{DBLP:journals/tods/ChapmanLMT24,
DBLP:journals/tvcg/CaiGXYWXWLW25,DBLP:conf/deem/PinaCK0M24} show the data flow
and transformations in various domains such as
databases~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0912-5340, DBLP:conf/icdt/BunemanKT01},
and machine learning pipelines~\cite{DBLP:conf/deem/PinaCK0M24,
DBLP:journals/tods/ChapmanLMT24}. However, they often lack the ability to
effectively visualize intermediate results, which are crucial for understanding
the data transformations and debugging processes but instead force users to
inspect the process them along with the graph structure.
% visualizing data transformation
Visualization of intermediate results~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/LeeTABCKMSYHP21,
DBLP:conf/chi/WangLDM025}. DataFormulator2~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/WangLDM025}
provide systems for users to transform and visualize intermediate results rather
than showing the provenance graph structure. And
Lux~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/WangLDM025} visualizes the intermediate insights in
jupyter notebook. However, they do not show the data flow and transformations in
the provenance graph.
